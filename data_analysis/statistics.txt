Always data speaks with each person or organization differently.

Ex: We have last 10 years rain data in Praksam distict with location, time, date, rain centimeters, mandal, village, affect, people effected, homes destroyed, etc

If you are rural and urban town planning engineer, you need 
	1. How many homes collapsed?
	2. Is there any drinage problem occured?
	3. Is water stayin in village itself?

If you are appolo hospital owner
	1. How many people affected due to home collapse?
	2. How many people affected due to weather changes like fever, cold etc?
	3. Do we have bones specialist and corresponding medicines?
	4. Do we have seasonal fever specialist and corresponding madicines?








Types of Analysis:
------------------
Based on source of data we classified analysis into two types.

Statistical Analysis or Quantitative Analysis:
---------------------------------------------
Collecting, Cleaning, exploring insights from large amount of data to identify patterns and trends.


Non Statistical Analysis or Qualitative Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------
It provides genereic information means text, images, audio and video data to identyfy patterns and trends.


Data analysis involves:
----------------------
Data analysis covers following

Data Collection:
---------------
Every analysis starts with data collection. Collecting data from different sources like databases, apis, files and internet etc

Data Cleaning:
--------------
Once we have data, need to clean. It involves reshaping, changing data types, handling missing values and removing outliers etc

Data Exploration:
----------------
Drawing visual graphs using matplotlib, seaborn etc. To understand underlaying patterns, relationships, trends within the data

Drawing Conclusions:
--------------------
Based on visuals drawing conclusions.


Analysis vs Analytics:
---------------------
Analysis and analytics both looks same but they are different. Analysis will focus on past data and analytics will focus on future data.

Analytics is a scientific process of transforming data into insights for better decision making.





Classification of data analytics:
---------------------------------
1. Descriptive Analytics (What happened?)
2. Diagnostic Analytics (Why did it happended?)
3. Predective Analytics (What will happen?)
4. Prescriptive Analytics (How can we make it happen?)


types of variables:
------------------
1. Categorical
2. Numerical

Categorical varibles:
--------------------
Varabiles which can be grouped based on it's category
ex: gender, marriage status, colors etc

Numerical variables:
--------------------
1. Descrete
2. Continuous

Descrete Variables:
-------------------
Discrete variable one in which no value can be assumed between two given values. Variables which can be counted as integers.
ex: no.of childrens, no.of bugs etc.

Continuous Variables:
---------------------
Continuous variable on in which any value can be assumed between tow given values. Variables which can be counted as float numbers.
ex: weight, time etc.


Variable:
--------
Variable is a characteristic value of any member of population.
ex: age, gender, color of skin, designation etc.


Quantitative Variable:
----------------------
A variable differing in quantity is called quantitative variable.
ex: weight of person, no of people in bus


Qualitative Variable:
---------------------
A variable differeing in quality called qualitative variable.
ex: color and degree of damage to a car in an accident.


Measures of Frequency:
----------------------
The number of occurances of any particular data value in the given data set.





Convinence Sampling:
--------------------
This is a type of sampling with biased












Types of Data
-------------
1. Qualitative data
2. Quantitative data



Qualitative Data:
-----------------
It deals with characters and descriptions that can't be measured easily, but we can observe

Nominal Data:
-------------
Data which has order does not matter.
Ex: Gender

Ordinal Data:
------------
Data which order matter.
Ex: Ratings
