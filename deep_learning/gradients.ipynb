    "Gradients:\n",
    "    Gradients will update weights and bias of nueral network to reduce loss during training.\n",
    "    They determine how fast, how smoothly and how intellegently model learns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Descent (GD):\n",
    "    w = w - lr * dL/dw     # lr = Learning rate\n",
    "    Updates all weights at once using the entire dataset.\n",
    "    It is simple and accurate.\n",
    "    Very slow and not used in practical deep larning, because for entire dataset it will calculate at once so need high GPU and CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):\n",
    "    w = w - lr * gradient\n",
    "    weitht updates will happen for one sample at a time.\n",
    "    Faster than Gradient Descent but slow due to one sample at a time, what if one million records\n",
    "\n",
    "Mini-Batch SGD:\n",
    "    Uses small batches of data (32, 64, etc.)\n",
    "    Best balance of speed + stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum:\n",
    "    v=βv+αg, w=w−v\n",
    "    Adds \"memory\" to the updates → moves faster in the right direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaGrad:\n",
    "    Using high learning rate in begining and slowly decreased learning rate towards global minima.\n",
    "    w = w − (lr/sqrt(G + e)) * gradient\n",
    "    Larger updates for infrequent features, Smaller updates for frequent features. Means begining leraning rate is high, after learning starts it will     reduce towards global minima\n",
    "    Learning may become very small that it wll make gradient values will be almost zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSProp:\n",
    "    G=βG+(1−β)g2\n",
    "    Fixes AdaGrad’s problem of shrinking learning rates too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam:\n",
    "    mt = β1 * mt−1 + (1−β1) * g\n",
    "    vt = β2 * vt−1 + (1−β2) * g2\n",
    "    w = w − α * (mt/((sqrt(vt) + e))\n",
    "    Adam = Momentum + RMSProp. Best default optimizer for deep learning."
