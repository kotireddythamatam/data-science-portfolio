    "Why we need CNN, we have already ANN?\n",
    "ANN's can't handle images efficiently, but CNN's specially designed for image processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason 1: ANN Cannot Scale to Image Size (Too Many Parameters)\n",
    "    Color image has size = 256 * 256 * 3 = 196,608 inputs\n",
    "    In input layer need 196,608 nuerons, becasue each pixcel has separate independent feature\n",
    "    If hidden layer has 100 nuerons then weight parameters = 196,608 * 100 = 1,96,60,800\n",
    "    To update too many weight parameters\n",
    "    Extremely slow, Hard to train, Requires huge memory, Overfits easily\n",
    "    CNN solves this using small filters (e.g., 3×3) → only 9 parameters per filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason 2: ANN Cannot Detect Local Patterns\n",
    "    Images have local patterns like: edges, corners, colors, textures, shapes\n",
    "    ANN treats all pixels independently, without knowing which pixels are near each other.\n",
    "    CNN uses filters that slide over the image, so it understands spatial patterns.\n",
    "    ANN → thinks pixel at top-left is same as pixel at bottom-right\n",
    "    CNN → understands the structure of the image\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason 3: ANN Cannot Handle Image Position Changes\n",
    "    If a cat appears in the top-left vs center vs bottom-right, ANN gets confused.\n",
    "    CNN has a property called translation invariance\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason 4: ANN Doesn’t Use Shared Weights\n",
    "    ANN: Each connection has a separate weight → millions of parameters\n",
    "    CNN: One small filter (like 3×3 with 9 weights) moves across the image → same weights reused, This is called weight sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason 5: ANN Can’t Automatically Extract Features\n",
    "    To use ANN for images, you must manually create features like: edges, corner points, textures, gradients, shapes\n",
    "    CNN learns these features automatically during training.\n",
    "        First layer → learns edges\n",
    "        Middle layers → learns shapes\n",
    "        Deep layers → learns objects (eyes, faces, car wheels)\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution Nueral Network (CNN):\n",
    "    It allows the network to see patterns in images such as edges, shapes, objects etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution:\n",
    "    Sliding a small filter over an image and multiplying values to detect patterns.\n",
    "    Valid Convolution: No padding applied, after applying filter will loose some pixels in output.\n",
    "    Same Convolution: Padding applied, after appying filter will get same pixels as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kernal:\n",
    "    It is a small matrix used to scan image and extract features.\n",
    "    Sizes: 3 * 3, 5 * 5, 7 * 7 etc\n",
    "    Example: 3 * 3\n",
    "        [ 1  0 -1\n",
    "          1  0 -1\n",
    "          1  0 -1 ]\n",
    "\n",
    "Stride:\n",
    "    It decide how many pixels the filter jump each time\n",
    "    Stride = 1 → Move 1 step → output is big\n",
    "    Stride = 2 → Move 2 steps → output is smaller\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    Input = 6×6\n",
    "    Filter = 3×3\n",
    "    Stride 1 → output 4×4\n",
    "    Stride 2 → output 2×2\n",
    "\n",
    "Padding:\n",
    "    Adding extra pixels around the image\n",
    "    because\n",
    "        Keep image size same after convolution\n",
    "        Prevent losing edge information, edges are not getting repeated in filters.\n",
    "        Useful in deep networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Max Pooling:\n",
    "    Pooling reduces image size while keeping important features.\n",
    "    It is used after convolution layer.\n",
    "    It reduces Computation, Overfitting\n",
    "    Max pooling 2×2 → takes the maximum value in each 2×2 block.\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    [1 3\n",
    "     2 5] → max = 5\n",
    "    Average Pooling: It will get average of all pixels in block\n",
    "    Min Pooling: It will get least important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Flatten:\n",
    "    It converts 2D feature map into 1D vector so that it can be fed into Dense fully connected layer.\n",
    "    CNN layers output 2D features, Dense layers need 1D input, Flatten acts as a bridge: Conv → Dense\n",
    "    Convolution output Shape = (8, 8, 32)\n",
    "    Flatten converts this to: (8*8*32) = (2048,)\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout:\n",
    "    Randomly turns off a fraction of nuerons during training. It reduce overfitting.\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    Dropout rate = 0.3\n",
    "    → 30% neurons are randomly set to 0 every batch\n",
    "    → 70% neurons work normally\n",
