What is machine learning?
It is a subset of artificial intelligence. Making machines learn from data, means machines learn from data instead of explicity programmed. In other words, making machines self learn insted of some external training.

Machine learning uses algorithms to:
Learn patterns from data
Improve performance with experience
Make predictions or decisions based on what it learned


Explain difference between machine learning and deep learning?
In Machine learning, computers learn from large datasets using algorithms to perform tasks like prediction and recommendation. Whereas Deep learning uses a complex structure of algorithms developed similar to the human brain.


What are different stages in machine learning?
1. Data Collection: In this step, collect data from different sources like files, databases, pictures, audio, video etc
2. Data Pre-Procssing: It covers cleaning data. Includes removing duplicate values, handling missing values etc
3. Selecting Model: Choose correct model based on dataset complexity and prediction type
4. Train Model: Train the model using train data set
5. Evaluate Model: Evaluate model using test data set which model never seen it
6. Hypertuning and Optimization: Hyper tune parameters and test performance
7. Deploy Model: Deploy the model


What are different types in machine learning?
Machine learning has mainly three types
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Semi Supervised Learning
4. Reinforcement Learning


What is supervised learning?
The training dataset has input features and output labels. The model learns the relationship between input and output. After training, it can predict the output for new input data.


What is unsupervised learning?
The training dataset has only input features and no output labels. The model trains on input data to find patterns or groups, such as clusters.
Unsupervised learning does not predict outputs. it discovers patterns or groups in unlabeled data

What is Semisupervised learning?
It is not fully supervised nor unsupervised, means some of the data has output features and some has no output features.


What is reinforcement learning?
The model (agent) learns by interacting with an environment. It takes actions and receives rewards or penalties, and learns to choose actions that maximize total reward.


What is entropy?
Entropy measures the impurity or uncertainty present in the data


What is information gain?
It indicates how much information a particular feature or variable give us about the final outcome
It will tell us which question to ask and which attribute should be selected as decision node.


What is confusion matrix?
Confusion matrix is a table that describe performance of classification model on test data for which true value are known.

 
What is regression?
Regression is a machine learning technique used to predict number. Output is contineous number
Predicting continuous numerical values using past data

What regression will do?
- Looks at input features (X)
- Looks at output labels (y)
- Finds and learn relationship between them
- Uses leared rearned relationship to predict new features.



What is linear regression?
Linear regression is a machine learning algorithm used to predict number by fitting stright line through data. It's output is continueos value.
Relationship between input and output is straight line
It comes under regression task

y = mx + c
where 
	y = output
	m = slope (how fast y increases)
	x = input feaure
	c = intercept (starting value)


Give me an example how liner regression will work?
X, y = (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 4), (5, 5)

We need to findout m and c for y = mx + c
so x and y are mean of X and y

so x = 3 and y = 3.6

m = sum((x-x`)(y-y`))/ sum((x-x`)**2)

assume m = 0.4 and c = 2.4

so now predicted points are
y = 0.4 * 1 + 2.4 for x = 1 and same for remaing
once you draw that is predicted line and check error between actual y and predicted y


How does linear regression will learn?
- Take input features (X) and target values (y)
- Assume a linear relationship y = wX + b
- Start with Random Line
- Make predictions
- Calculate error using Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Update weights and bias to reduce error
- Repeat until error is minimized
- Use the final equation to predict continuous values
Repeated block: Prediction → Loss → Update


When should we use linear regression?
- Output is numeric
- Relationship is roughly linear
- Data doen't have extreme outliers
If you are predicting a number and the relationship looks like a straight line


What is R**2 in linear regression?
R**2 tell us how good is the line we draw.
R**2 = sum((y_pred - y`)**2) / sum((y - y`)**2)


What is adjusted R**2?
R**2 never decrease eventhough adding unnecessary features
Adjusted R**2 tell us how good is the line we draw without unncecessary features.


What do you mean by best fit?
Total error between actual values and predicted values should be minimum.



What is logistic regression?
Logistic regression is a machine learning algorithm used for classification problem.
eventhough name says regression, it is used for classification problem.
It's output is binary value like 0 and 1, yes and no, pass and fail, spam and not spam etc.
Relationship between input and output is S - shaped curve.
It comes under regression task
Logistic Regression predicts probabilities and class labels using a sigmoid function.


How logistic regression will work?
- Take input features (X) and class labels (y ∈ {0,1})
- Compute linear combination z = wX + b
- Apply sigmoid function to convert z into probability
- Calculate error using Log Loss (Cross-Entropy)
- Update weights and bias to reduce error
- Repeat until loss is minimized
- Apply threshold (usually 0.5)
- Output class labels (0 or 1)
Repeated block: Linear output → Sigmoid → Loss → Update

When to use logistic regression?
- Binary output
- when you want probability and class. Class means 0 and 1, yes and no etc
- Relationship is roughly linear
- Dataset is small or medium


When not to use logistic regression?
- If output has more than two classes
- If data has ver complex non-linear patterns
- If feature relationships are highly complex


What do you mean by linearly separable?
Data is linearly separable if you can separate classes using a straight line (or flat surface).
Ex:
Suppose we have
	Red dots → Class 0
	Blue dots → Class 1
If you can draw one straight line that separates red and blue points without mixing, the data is linearly separable.


What do you mean by non-linear?
When a straight line is NOT enough to separate the data.
You need:
	Curves
	Circles
	Complex shapes
Ex:
Imagine points arranged in a circle:
	Class 1 → Inside the circle
	Class 0 → Outside the circle
No straight line can separate them, A curve is needed


What is Multicollinearity?
Multicollinearity happens when two or more input features are highly correlated with each other.
They carry almost the same information.
Ex:
Suppose you are predicting house price using:
	Feature 1: House size in square feet
	Feature 2: House size in square meters
These two features are strongly correlated (1 sq m ≈ 10.76 sq ft).
This is multicollinearity.



Difference between linear and logistic regression?

| Step         | Linear Regression | Logistic Regression |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Input        | Features (X)      | Features (X)        |
| Equation     | y = mX + c        | z = mX + c          |
| Extra step   | None              | Sigmoid             |
| Output       | Number            | Probability         |
| Final result | Continuous value  | Class (0/1)         |
| Loss         | MSE               | Log Loss            |


What is classification?
Classification is a process of dividing dataset into different categories or groups by adding label.



What is decision tree?
Decision tree is a graphical representations of all possibilites to a decision based on certain conditions.


What are reinforcement learning definations?
Agent: Agent is reinforcement learning algorithm which learns from trail and error
Environment: Environment is place where agent moves.
Action: All possible steps an agent can take
State: Current condition returned by the environment





What is coefficient?
These are parameters which shows how strongly independent variable affects dependent variable.


What is intercept?
Intercept is a constant which indicates starting point.


What are different types of logistic regression?
1. Binary Logistic Regression:
	Target or dependant varible has exaclty two outcomes
	Ex: yes and no, spam and not spam etc
2. Multinominal Logistic Regression:
	Target or dependant variable has more than two outcomes and order is not important
	Ex: cat, dog and mouse etc
3. Ordinal Logistic Regression:
	Target or dependant variable has more than two outcomes and order is important
	Ex: A, B, C, D(rankings) etc


How train_test_split work if test_size=0.2?
without stratify case, shuffle all records in data. take first 80% as train data and remaing 20% as test data.
with stratify case uses stratified sampling technique, group by class all records in data. Take 20% as test data and remaing as train data from each group


Difference between train_test_split(test_size=0.2) vs train_test_split(train_size=0.8)?
in train test split alway head data used as train tail data used as test
Ex: 
	X = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
	y = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

	if stratify=y then group based on classes (1 = 60%, 0 = 40%)
		class 1 = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
		class 0 = [16, 17, 18, 19]

		if shuffle=True then
			class1_shuffled = [12,10,14,11,15,13]
			class0_shuffled = [18,16,19,17]

			Class 1:
				class1_train = class1_shuffled * 80% (means first 80% of the data) = [12,10,14,11,15]
				class1_test  = class1_train - remaing items = [13]

			Class 0:
				class0_train = class0_shuffled * 80% (means first 80% of the data) =  = [18,16,19]
				class0_test = class0_train - remaing items = [17]

			finally combine both classes for X and for y we can consider corresponding y
				X_train = class1_train + class0_train = [12,10,14,11,15,18,16,19]
				y_train = [ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

				X_test  = class1_test + class0_test = [13,17]
				y_test  = [ 1, 0]

		otherwise
			this case not possible

	otherwise same X, y
		X = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
		y = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

		if shuffle=True then
			X_shuffled = [12,18,14,19,11,16,17,13,10,15]
			y_shuffled = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

			X_train = X_shuffled * 80% (means first 80% of the data) = [12,18,14,19,11,16,17,13]
			y_train = y_shuffled * 80% (means first 80% of the data) = [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1]

			X_test = X_train - remaing items = [10,15]
			y_test = y_train - remaing items = [1,1] # no 0 classes

		otherwise		
			X_train = X * 80% (means first 80% of the data = [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17]
			y_train = y * 80% (means first 80% of the data) = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

			X_test  = X_train - remaing items = [18,19]
			y_test  = y_train - remaing items = [0, 0]


What is stratify in train_test_split?
Stratify keeps all class distributions in both train and test data


When should use stratify in train_test_split?
- For classification problems
- When classes are imbalanced(yes-90%, no-10%)
- Dataset is small(1f 30 records then Test data may lose no-10% class)


When not to use stratify in train_test_split?
- For regression problems
- For time series data


What is shuffle and random_state in train_test_split?
Shuffle is used change data order
random_state is used to control shuffle. Means every time same data split. like Shuffle once, remember the order forever


What is the need of shuffle and random_state?
if no shuffle then train and test split is not good
if no random state then every time train and test split data will be different.


Why do we need to standard scaler?
Standard scaler makes all features in same scale
makes mean=0 and standard deviaion=1
Ex:
	Height in cm
	weith in kg
	It converted raw measurements into distance-from-average scores.


What is difference between fit, transform and fit transform?
fit: Learns parameters from the data
transform: Applies the learned parameters to transform data
fit_transform: Learns parameters and transforms the data in one step


What is difference between fit_transform(X_train) and transform(X_test)
fit transform will do learn parameters from X_train data and apply those to X_train data
transform will apply learned parameters from X_train data to to X_test data
always call fit_transform first then only transform, because scaler has to learn to transform


What is accuracy_score?
Accuracy score is model evaluation technique, It tells you overall correctness of model
It is the division between correct predections to the total predictions.
accuracy_score = correct_predictions / total_predictions



What is classification report?
It is model evaluation technique, It tells you detailed performance of each class
